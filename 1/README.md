* The archive must contain directly these source code files with the implementation
 of the required feature, without any nested folders.

* `Makefile`, `test.c` - all that is going to be ignored anyway,
  do not attach them. The system uses the original build scripts and tests.

* The solution can contain any number of .c and .h files, they are all going to
  be compiled together.
